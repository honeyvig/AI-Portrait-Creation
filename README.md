# AI-Portrait-Creation
Here's a full Python solution to create the AI portrait creation flow based on your requirements. This will include the ability to upload photos, detect and group faces, collect customer instructions, and prepare for further steps (such as generating the portrait).

We will use OpenCV for face detection and Flask for a simple web application where users can upload images and provide instructions.
Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to install the required libraries:

pip install flask opencv-python tensorflow pillow numpy

1. Face Detection and Upload Flow
1.1 Flask Web App for Upload and Face Detection

import cv2
import numpy as np
import os
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify, redirect, url_for
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set up the upload folder and allowed extensions
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg'}

app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER


# Function to check allowed file extensions
def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS


# Function for face detection using OpenCV
def detect_faces(image_path):
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
    
    return faces, img


# Function to save and crop faces from the image
def group_faces(image_path):
    faces, img = detect_faces(image_path)
    face_groups = []
    
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        face_img = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        face_groups.append(face_img)
        
        # Optionally save faces separately
        cv2.imwrite(f"static/face_{x}_{y}.jpg", face_img)
    
    return face_groups


# Route to handle file upload
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')


@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_image():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return redirect(request.url)
    
    file = request.files['file']
    
    if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
        filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
        filepath = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
        file.save(filepath)
        
        # Process image: detect and group faces
        face_groups = group_faces(filepath)
        
        return render_template('faces.html', faces=face_groups, image_path=filepath)
    
    return redirect(url_for('index'))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

HTML Template - index.html (Upload Page)

Create a file called index.html in the templates folder:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Upload Image for Portrait Creation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Upload Your Image</h1>
    <form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="file" accept="image/*" required>
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>

HTML Template - faces.html (Faces Grouping and Instruction Page)

Create a file called faces.html in the templates folder:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Review Faces</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Select Faces</h1>
    <p>Click on the face(s) that you want to include in your portrait.</p>
    
    <div>
        {% for face in faces %}
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='face_' + face) }}" alt="Face Image">
        {% endfor %}
    </div>

    <form action="/customize" method="post">
        <textarea name="instructions" placeholder="Enter your instructions here..." required></textarea>
        <br>
        <button type="submit">Submit Instructions</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>

2. Processing the Customer's Instructions

You can create a route to handle customer instructions (like adding glasses, changing hairstyle, etc.). For now, we assume this will be a simple text input, but this can be further enhanced using a more complex natural language processing model like GPT-3 to interpret the instructions.
Customer Instructions Route

@app.route('/customize', methods=['POST'])
def customize():
    instructions = request.form.get('instructions')
    
    # You can process the instructions here to modify the portrait generation logic
    # In a real implementation, you would call an AI model to generate and modify the portrait
    return jsonify({"message": "Instructions received: " + instructions})

3. Generating the Portrait with Style

Once the instructions are received, you can generate the custom portrait. This step can be achieved by using AI-powered image processing models, such as Style Transfer (using models like VGG16, etc.) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

You would need to:

    Integrate an AI model to apply style changes based on customer instructions.
    Save the generated image and offer a download option for the customer.

4. Final Integration

To complete this process, you'd need to:

    Process the customerâ€™s feedback on the generated portrait.
    Use iterative steps for feedback and enhancement.
    Implement a feedback loop where the customer can leave comments directly on the portrait.

This could be implemented via additional routes and more complex AI models for image generation (like StyleGAN, etc.).
Notes:

    This implementation serves as a basic framework for a user-friendly AI portrait creation system.
    Further, you can integrate more advanced AI tools and fine-tune the model to cater to various artistic styles and requirements.
    You should handle error cases, security, and performance optimizations for a production-ready system.

This is a starting point for building a full-fledged AI-powered portrait generator with customer-driven customization and iterative feedback!
